# shipgrrr
ShipGrrr game written in Python IDLE and PyGame for Code in Place 2025

"""
Ahoy, matey! Thank you for playing ShipGrrr online, a final project submission for Stanford University's Code in Place 2025 program.

This challenging student-selected project, written in Python with the Pygame library, was part of the course requirements for the Experienced Student track, which led to a certificate of completion.

Navigate Captain Kai's ship across a dangerous ocean filled with both hidden and looming hazards! Steer the ship using the Up, Right, and Left arrow keys.

Your mission: Reach the ocean refueling station before the ship runs out of fuel.

As the navigator on Captain Kai's ship, you must watch out for and avoid:

Ship Hazards & Sea Creatures you will encounter, such as -

* Icebergs: Stationary ship-sinking obstacles appearing randomly near the top refueling zone at the start of each new game round.
* Orcas: These large sea creatures, also known as “killer whales,” swim across the ship’s navigation lanes.
* Cachalots: 50-foot toothed whales that swim from side to side and appear in open lanes.
* Kraken Tentacles: These monster-like arms unexpectedly rise up from the ocean depths and can drag a ship down below the water.

Ship navigators beware! Collisions with these hazards and sea creatures can damage or sink your ship. Steer your ship's course WISELY to avoid a shipwreck.

Challenge:

Ready to dive deeper? Install Python and the Pygame and restructure this code to create your own exciting ocean scenario.
Post your version of ShipGrrr to social media and let me know how you liked the game or if you found any bugs!

Thanks again, have fun, and happy sailing!
