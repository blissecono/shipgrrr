SHIPGRRR GAME CREDITS:

ShipGrrr is written in Python IDLE and the Pygame library, authored by Michelle Bliss with some strategic assistance from Google's Gemini artificial intelligence program.

Credit for The Kraken tentacle goes to Gemini as the AI insisted on including tentacles to enrich the game's playability and improve its design concept.

Michelle Bliss's artistic collaboration on The Kraken's tentacles was to develop it in the manner of the mythical Norse sea monster that randomly pops up from beneath the sea.

The mythical Kraken creature is depicted by a coded chain of balls that swings and hits the ship.

The chain-of-balls concept was demonstrated during a Code in Place game design workshop.

Google's Gemini AI provided the mathematics for drawing The Kraken tentacle chain of balls and calculating its swinging motions.

The AI also helped with the math coding for the game's aesthetic environment (e.g. ship, sun, orca patch, etc.).

Collaborative writing credit goes to Patrick Trotta, Michelle Bliss's business partner. With a creative synergy somewhat in the manner of Lennon and McCartney,
this writing team infused their conceptualization skills into the gaming-motivational text and helped enhance the game's starting safety zone.
